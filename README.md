#  DLPrototype

MacOS 11 is currently in dev/public beta, but I cannot upgrade any of my Macs to the new version to test the new cross platform SwiftUI 2.  So, this is a simple prototype that should capture what the DailyLogger application intends to accomplish.

The current workflow is basically:

```
# open terminal

logt "This is what I'm doing now"
logt "This is what I'm doing now"
logt "This is what I'm doing now"
logt "This is what I'm doing now"
logt "I'm done for the day"
```

New workflow will be basically that but with a GUI.  Eventually it will be a cross platform database of sorts.
